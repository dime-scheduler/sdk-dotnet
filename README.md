This repository contains the .NET SDK for Dime.Scheduler. The SDK is a gateway to connect _any_ system to Dime.Scheduler through its extensive import pipeline and large collection of web APIs.

## Installation

Use the package manager NuGet to install the SDK:

`dotnet add package Dime.Scheduler`

## Usage

The `DimeSchedulerClient` class is the entry point and it is where all endpoints are exposed:

```csharp
DimeSchedulerClient client = new("key");
```

> [!TIP]  
> An optional argument is available to use the sandbox environment.

Instantiate the object of choice and run it by its corresponding endpoint in the SDK.

```csharp
Category category = new("Category #1", "#6e62b5");
var response = await client.Indicators.Categories.CreateAsync(category);
```

## Endpoints and models

> [!TIP]
> Check out the **[ðŸ“š docs Â»](https://docs.dimescheduler.com/develop/sdk)** for more info.

The following endpoints are available in the `DimeSchedulerClient` class:

  - **Filter Group**
  - **Filter Value**
- **Message**: Send transient messages to the active users
- **Notification**: Persistent messages for tasks, appointments, jobs, or just a general message for everybody.
- **Resource**: The entity that can be planned. Can also be set:

  - **ResourceCalendar**: Assign a calendar to a resource for a given date range.
  - **ResourceCapacity**: Used in the capacity pivot.
  - **ResourceGpsTracking**: Update the current location of the resource.
  - **ResourceCertificate**: obsolete
  - **ResourceUri**: Add a link to relevant documentation about this resource.
- **Job**: The parent entity of a task that contains data such as customer and contact info, addresses, etc.

  - **TaskContainer**: Link tasks via a container.
- **Appointment**: assigment of a task to a resource on a certain date and time. Can also be set:
  - **AppointmentCategory**: Change the background color
  - **AppointmentContent**: Change subject and body
  - **AppointmentLocked**: Lock/unlock appointment on the planning board

It is possible that an endpoint may accept more than one model, such as those that target specific functionalities.  For instance, in the appointment endpoint, an instance of `AppointmentLocked` can be invoked:

```csharp
 AppointmentLocked appointmentLock = new()
 {
     SourceApp = "BC_USA_BRANCH",
     SourceType = "SERVICE",

     // The GUID of the appointment we'd like to update
     AppointmentGuid = "2a77f6c6-c502-4ad2-9ee2-6fba0f9361a1"     
     
     Locked = true
 };

await dimeScheduler.Appointments.UpdateAsync(appointmentLock);
```
