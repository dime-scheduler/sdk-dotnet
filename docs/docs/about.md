## Stop puzzling, start planning

Powered by advanced web technologies, Dime.Scheduler is a comprehensive and easy-to-implement graphical planning solution. Boasting a modern and intuitive interface, this interactive and integrated app lets you schedule your tasks, jobs, absences, service, production, assembly and sales related orders, or even entire projects; group, sort and filter your tasks in multiple panels and drag them onto one or more planning boards, and much more.

## One planning, one flexible tool

No matter whether you just need a simple planning tool or a more comprehensive planning solution, Dime.Scheduler has been built to work with you while you grow your business.
Already widely used in many industries, Dime.Scheduler lets anything be a resource or a task. Whereas many planning solutions limit themselves to just one part of the business, Dime. Scheduler manages the resource allocation and project planning needs for all companies, business units or teams within your organization. And it integrates perfectly with your back-office applications.

## Integration

Dime.Scheduler is driven by your back office data. You select which entities are pushed to the planning board. Bi-directional integration synchronizes all the changes in resource allocations to the back office application and vice versa, all in real time. Any changes in your back office application can also update any appointments and their related visual markers for status, progress, or whatever you have defined.
Dime.Scheduler comes with a standard connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (NAV) and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales (CRM).
