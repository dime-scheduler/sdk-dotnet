These docs provide all the information you need to know about the Dime.Scheduler SDK for .NET. For the application's documentation, continue [ðŸ“š here](https://docs.dimescheduler.com).


Most of the application's capabilities are exposed through RESTful services, so in a way the SDK is an easy to use wrapper around the web APIs.
Flexibility is one the application's cornerstones, and this idea has been applied with the SDK as well, as the user of the SDK is in total control. And by making the SDK open source, you can always resort to editing the source code to make it work the way you like it.
