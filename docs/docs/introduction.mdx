This repository contains the .NET SDK for Dime.Scheduler. Most of the application's capabilities are exposed through RESTful services, so in a way the SDK is an easy to use wrapper around the web APIs.

Flexibility is one the application's cornerstones, and this philosophy has been but into effect with the SDK as well, as the user of the SDK is in total control. And by making the repository open source, you can always resort to editing the source code to make it work the way you like it.
